# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
The main aim is to develop a system or model capable of accurately detecting diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus images. This detection facilitates early diagnosis and intervention, aiming to prevent vision loss and improve outcomes for individuals with diabetes. Detection methods typically employ image analysis techniques on retinal fundus images to identify signs of retinopathy, such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates. 
Main objectives are:
Early Detection
Accuracy Improvement
Automation
Accessibility
Integration with existing healthcare infrastructure
