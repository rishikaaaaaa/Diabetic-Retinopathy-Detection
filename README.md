# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
Developing a system to detect diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus images, enabling early diagnosis and intervention strategies, crucial for preventing vision loss and improving outcomes in individuals with diabetes.
Detection methods typically employ image analysis techniques on retinal fundus images to identify signs of retinopathy, such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates.
